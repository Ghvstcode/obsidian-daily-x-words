##Â daily-x-words

A plugin for Obsidian that helps you track and visualize your daily writing progress.

### About

The daily-x-words plugin is a fork of the obsidian-daily-stats plugin, with additional features and customization options. It is designed to encourage and support daily writing habits by providing a heatmap visualization of your progress and prompts to help you get started. The heatmap shows each day as a box, with the color indicating whether you reached your target word count (dark green), wrote but didn't reach your target (light green), or didn't write at all (white).

This plugin was inspired by the [Five Hundred Words a Day website](https://www.fivehundredwordsaday.com), which promotes the idea of writing 500 words a day as a way to improve your writing skills and productivity. The daily-x-words plugin takes this concept and adapts it for use in Obsidian, allowing you to customize your target word count and easily track your progress over time.
